# Snippets
Data Structure and Algorithm Snippets

All snippets are written in C++

## Planned Templates/Other To-Dos

* DS
    * Dynamic Square Root Decomposition: [Maintaining Some Coins](https://dmoj.ca/problem/cpc19c1p6)
    * Split-Merge Treap
    * Implicit Treap
* Algorithms
    * Tarjan's Bridge Finding Algorithm (basically the same thing as articulation points)
    * Centroid Decomposition (Flexible template, similar to trie)
    * Centroid Tree (Flexible template, similar to trie)
* Utilities
    * Flat graph (Both adjecency lists are just arrays)
* Updates
    * Generalize BFS to allow for flat graph
    * Generalize Dijkstra to allow for flat graph


## Templates that need to be ported

* LCA (Euler Tour)
* LCA (Binary Lifting)
* Prefix Sum/Max/Min array, Difference Array
