CMake Error at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2019.1.2/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.14/Modules/CMakeMinGWFindMake.cmake:12 (message):
  sh.exe was found in your PATH, here:

  C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/sh.exe

  For MinGW make to work correctly sh.exe must NOT be in your path.

  Run cmake from a shell that does not have sh.exe in your PATH.

  If you want to use a UNIX shell, then use MSYS Makefiles.
