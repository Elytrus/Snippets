Heh... not bad, [user]. Not bad at all. Your code, I mean. It's not bad. A good first attempt. It's plenty clean… I can tell it's got some thought behind it... lots of quotable material... But coding isn't all sunshine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that much I can tell. But do you have what it takes to be a coder? To join those esteemed purple-yellow-red ranks? To call yourself a member of the dmoj slack? Coding takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it takes heart. The world-class coders - I mean the big guys, like **liwi** and **AQT** - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight dmoj-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big AC. And you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new code fails. Judges dismisses it as bait, or says it's “WA,” or ignores it as they look at the latest “Hello World” submission sent up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate coders like **TimothyW553**… The dmoj grind is rough, kid, and I don't just mean the one you just lost :). It's a rough business, and for every code you craft in your eclipse directory, some cocksucker at github.com has a hundreds of jimgao’s submissions to farm points off of. Chin up, kid. Don't get all mopey on me. You've got skill. You've got talent. You just need to show your drive.
